# BiSCAN
This is Bidimensional Scan Analyzer (BiSCAN), written in Python! It simultaneously plots the energy profile of a bidimensional relaxed scan and the converged geometries of your system. Anytime you click on a point of the energy profile, the geometry representation updates to show the conformation associated to that point!
